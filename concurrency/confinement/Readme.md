## The confinement pattern 
1. In Go (Golang) is a concurrency pattern used to safely share data between goroutines without using mutexes or other synchronization primitives. The idea is to confine the ownership of the data to a single goroutine, which is the only one allowed to mutate it. Other goroutines can only interact with this data by sending messages to the owning goroutine via channels.
2. Confined is the mechanism insuring the information is only available from 1 concurrent goroutine
